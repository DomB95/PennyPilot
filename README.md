# Penny Pilot

PennyPilot is a lightweight, user-friendly budgeting application designed for people who want to take control of their finances without linking a bank account. Instead of pulling data from financial institutions, PennyPilot asks smart, personalized questions to understand a userâ€™s income, expenses, and savings goals.

Using built-in formulas and geolocation-based tax estimates, the app helps users calculate their take-home pay and builds a simple, actionable savings plan tailored to their lifestyle. Whether you're a student, freelancer, or just trying to save more, PennyPilot makes budgeting approachable and stress-free.
